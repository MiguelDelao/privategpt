## üöß Known Issues

### Database Layer
- **SQLAlchemy Async Issues**: Conversation creation fails due to async session management
- **Migration Strategy**: Need proper database schema migration approach
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections not optimally managed

### Authentication
- **Token Edge Cases**: Some authentication edge cases need resolution
- **Session Management**: Improve session persistence and cleanup

### Performance
- **Response Times**: Some endpoints slower than optimal
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption with enhanced features

## üìã Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **MCP Local Implementation**: Chose STDIO over HTTP for better local integration
- **XML Structured Prompts**: Enables rich UI rendering and thinking display
- **Single-Page Dashboard**: Simplified from tabs for better usability
- **Database Schema v2**: Enhanced to support advanced chat features

### Technical Debt
- **Authentication Bypass**: Temporary auth bypass for testing needs proper fix
- **Error Handling**: Some error cases not gracefully handled
- **Code Documentation**: Some new modules need better documentation

### Next Steps Priority
1. **Fix database async issues** - Critical for chat functionality
2. **Complete RAG integration** - Connect existing RAG service
3. **Production hardening** - Security and error handling
4. **React UI development** - Modern frontend replacement
