## üîÑ In Progress

### Production Hardening (High Priority)  
- [ ] Re-enable authentication with configurable debug mode
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation and API key validation
- [ ] Security audit and vulnerability testing
- [ ] Provider-specific error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Rate limiting for external API providers
- [ ] Cost tracking and usage monitoring for cloud providers
- [ ] Increase Docker memory allocation for larger models

### RAG Functionality (Medium Priority)
- [x] Connect RAG service to API gateway
- [x] Implement document upload and processing
- [x] Vector search integration with chat
- [ ] Document management UI improvements

---

## ‚è≥ Planned

### Test Coverage Implementation (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit test suite (domain, infrastructure, services)
- [ ] Add integration tests for multi-provider LLM system
- [ ] Create test fixtures for all providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing with Docker Compose
- [ ] Performance and load testing for streaming endpoints
- [ ] Security testing for authentication and API key handling

### React/Next.js UI Development (High Priority)

## üöß Known Issues

### Model Memory Constraints
- **Ollama Memory Limits**: Some models (llama3.2:1b) require more memory than available
- **Docker Resource Allocation**: Default 2GB limit insufficient for larger models
- **Workaround**: Use tinydolphin:latest for development (636MB)

### Authentication (Temporary)
- **Auth Middleware Disabled**: Authentication temporarily disabled for debugging
- **Security**: Need to re-enable auth with configurable debug mode
- **Session Management**: Improve session persistence and cleanup

### Database Layer  
- **SQLAlchemy Async Issues**: Some conversation creation may have async session management issues
- **Migration Strategy**: Need proper database schema migration approach
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections not optimally managed

### Performance
- **~~LLM Service Timeouts~~**: ‚úÖ **Fixed with 180s streaming timeout**
- **Response Times**: Some endpoints slower than optimal during model warmup
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption with enhanced features
- **Streaming Performance**: Real-time character-by-character display working optimally

## üìã Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **MCP Local Implementation**: Chose STDIO over HTTP for better local integration
- **XML Structured Prompts**: Enables rich UI rendering and thinking display
- **Single-Page Dashboard**: Simplified from tabs for better usability
- **Database Schema v2**: Enhanced to support advanced chat features
- **Tool Configuration**: Current hardcoded approach maintained while exploring UX for dynamic tool selection

### Technical Debt
- **Authentication Bypass**: Temporary auth bypass for testing needs proper fix
- **Provider Error Handling**: Need consistent error handling across all LLM providers
- **Test Coverage**: Minimal test coverage across the entire codebase
- **Code Documentation**: Multi-provider architecture needs comprehensive documentation
- **Configuration Validation**: Limited validation of provider API keys and endpoints
- **Performance Monitoring**: No metrics collection for provider response times and costs

### Next Steps Priority
1. **Implement comprehensive test coverage** - Critical for maintainability
2. **Complete RAG integration** - Connect existing RAG service
3. **Production hardening** - Multi-provider security and error handling
4. **Re-enable authentication** - Remove debug bypass mode
5. **React UI development** - Modern frontend replacement
