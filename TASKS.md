## üîÑ In Progress

### Production Hardening (High Priority)  
- [x] Re-enable authentication with full Keycloak integration
- [x] Remove debug code from authentication middleware (prints and excessive logging)
- [x] **Implement standardized error handling** - BaseServiceError hierarchy with consistent format
- [x] **Add request ID tracking** - RequestIDMiddleware for tracing across services
- [x] **Enhance error security** - Hide internal details in production mode
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Secure debug endpoints** - Remove authentication bypass for `/api/chat/debug/` and `/api/test/`
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Remove hardcoded values** - User ID 1 in testing scenarios, magic numbers
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Implement secret management** - Move API keys to environment variables
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Remove default admin credentials** from hardcoded config
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation and API key validation
- [ ] Security audit and vulnerability testing
- [ ] Provider-specific error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Rate limiting for external API providers
- [ ] Cost tracking and usage monitoring for cloud providers
- [ ] Increase Docker memory allocation for larger models

### Technical Debt Cleanup (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Fix Traefik Routing** - Gateway service not discoverable through Traefik proxy
  - Frontend currently requires direct gateway access (localhost:8000/api) 
  - Production should use clean URLs through proxy (localhost/api)
  - Traefik labels configured but service discovery failing
  - **Impact**: Different routing in dev vs production, hardcoded ports in frontend
- [ ] **Session Management**: Standardize on context manager pattern vs dependency injection
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error response format across all endpoints
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Remove hardcoded magic numbers (timeouts: 180s, 600s; limits: 1000, 4096)
- [ ] **TODO Completion**: Complete MCP integration implementation (remove TODO comments)
- [ ] **API Consistency**: Implement quick-chat endpoint (currently returns 501)
- [ ] **Database Patterns**: Remove raw SQL from business logic, use ORM consistently

### RAG Functionality (Medium Priority)
- [x] Connect RAG service to API gateway
- [x] Implement document upload and processing
- [x] Vector search integration with chat
- [ ] Document management UI improvements

## üìã Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **MCP Local Implementation**: Chose STDIO over HTTP for better local integration
- **XML Structured Prompts**: Enables rich UI rendering and thinking display
- **Single-Page Dashboard**: Simplified from tabs for better usability
- **Database Schema v2**: Enhanced to support advanced chat features
- **Tool Configuration**: Current hardcoded approach maintained while exploring UX for dynamic tool selection

### Technical Debt
- **CRITICAL: Traefik Routing Issue**: Gateway service not discoverable through Traefik proxy
  - Current: Frontend must use direct gateway (localhost:8000/api)
  - Target: Clean proxy URLs (localhost/api) for production parity
  - Impact: Dev/prod environment mismatch, hardcoded ports in frontend
- **Next.js Production Builds**: Currently configured for development mode only, needs production optimization
- **Provider Error Handling**: Need consistent error handling across all LLM providers
- **Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ **Improved** - Added comprehensive conversation/auth tests, need provider/RAG coverage
- **Code Documentation**: Multi-provider architecture needs comprehensive documentation
- **Configuration Validation**: Limited validation of provider API keys and endpoints
- **Performance Monitoring**: No metrics collection for provider response times and costs

### Next Steps Priority
1. **Implement comprehensive test coverage** - Critical for maintainability
2. **Complete RAG integration** - Connect existing RAG service
3. **Production hardening** - Multi-provider security and error handling
4. **Next.js UI chat functionality** - Complete real-time chat features
5. **Performance optimization** - Provider response times and caching
