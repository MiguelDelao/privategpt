## üìù Recent Changes

### 2025-01-19: Authentication Resolution
- **Fixed** UI login "Session expired or token invalid" errors
- **Corrected** JWKS endpoint URL format (openid-connect vs openid_connect)
- **Added** audience mapper in Keycloak for proper JWT validation
- **Updated** issuer validation to handle external vs internal URLs
- **Verified** complete authentication flow works with admin@admin.com/admin

### Architecture Simplification
- **Removed** standalone auth service (port 8001)

## üîç Notes

- **Default Credentials**: admin@admin.com / admin
- **Architecture**: Gateway handles auth + user management + routing
- **Current Status**: Full authentication working, ready for RAG implementation
- **Next Focus**: RAG chat functionality and document management UI
