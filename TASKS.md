## üìù Recent Changes

### 2025-01-19: Authentication Resolution
- **Fixed** UI login "Session expired or token invalid" errors
- **Corrected** JWKS endpoint URL format (openid-connect vs openid_connect)
- **Added** audience mapper in Keycloak for proper JWT validation
- **Updated** issuer validation to handle external vs internal URLs
- **Verified** complete authentication flow works with admin@admin.com/admin
- **Refactored** UI authentication from token validation to session-based approach
- **Simplified** architecture - gateway handles auth, UI manages session state

### Architecture Simplification
- **Removed** standalone auth service (port 8001)
- **Consolidated** user management into API Gateway
- **Simplified** from 4 to 3 microservices
- **Enhanced** with automated Keycloak realm configuration

## üîç Notes

- **Default Credentials**: admin@admin.com / admin
- **Architecture**: Gateway handles auth + user management + routing
- **Current Status**: Streamlit UI complete, authentication working, ready for production gateway APIs
- **Next Focus**: Production-ready gateway APIs for React/Next.js UI
- **UI Transition**: Moving from Streamlit to React/Next.js for better UX and tool call visualization
- **Chat History**: Need to design robust data model supporting tool calls, sources, and conversation threads
