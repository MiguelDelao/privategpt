# RAG & MCP Integration - Executive Summary

## 🎯 What You're Building

A sophisticated knowledge management system that allows users to:
1. **Organize documents** into collections and folders (hierarchical structure)
2. **Track processing** with real-time progress updates
3. **Control AI context** using @ mentions with path support
4. **Enable AI tools** to search and access these knowledge bases

## 📁 Key Concepts

### Collections & Folders = Hierarchical Organization
Familiar folder structure for organizing documents:
- **Attorney**: "Cases" > "Smith v Jones" > "Discovery", "Pleadings"
- **Researcher**: "Projects" > "2024 Study" > "Data", "Analysis"
- **Business**: "Operations" > "HR" > "Policies", "Procedures"

### @ Mention Context Selection
Users can type `@Cases` or use paths like `@Cases/Smith` for precise context:
- `@Cases What was the outcome of Smith v. Jones?`
- `@Cases/Smith/Discovery What documents were exchanged?`
- `@Regulations/Europe What are the GDPR requirements?`
- Multiple paths can be combined for broader searches

### Real-time Progress Tracking
When documents are uploaded:
1. Immediate acknowledgment with document ID
2. SSE stream shows processing steps
3. Frontend progress bar updates in real-time
4. Completion notification when ready for search

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
1. **RAG Service** - Document management with folder hierarchy
2. **Celery Workers** - Async document processing
3. **Redis** - Progress pub/sub and caching
4. **Weaviate** - Vector storage with collection namespacing
5. **MCP Tools** - AI-accessible search with path filtering

### Frontend Features
1. **Collection Browser** - Navigate folder hierarchy
2. **Document Uploader** - Drag-drop with progress visualization
3. **Context Mentions** - @ symbol with path autocomplete
4. **Folder View** - Current location with breadcrumb navigation

## 📊 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
✅ Database schema for collections with hierarchy
✅ CRUD APIs for collection/folder management
✅ Update document model with collection support
✅ Folder tree navigation UI

### Phase 2: Processing Pipeline (Week 2-3)
✅ Celery task with progress updates
✅ Redis pub/sub for SSE streaming
✅ Document chunking and embedding
✅ Frontend progress visualization

### Phase 3: MCP Integration (Week 3-4)
✅ Enhanced search tool with collection path filtering
✅ Tool factory for dynamic tool management
✅ Path-aware search capabilities
✅ Testing framework for tools

### Phase 4: Frontend Polish (Week 4-5)
✅ @ mention with path support
✅ Collection breadcrumb navigation
✅ Document preview and metadata
✅ Search result highlighting

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Week 5-6)
✅ Integration tests for full pipeline
✅ Performance optimization
✅ Error handling and recovery
✅ Documentation and examples

## 🚀 Next Immediate Actions

1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Create migration for collections schema
   alembic revision -m "Add collections hierarchy and update documents"
   # Apply migration
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **First API Endpoints**
   ```python
   # Add to rag_router.py
   @router.post("/collections")
   async def create_collection(...)
   
   @router.get("/collections/{id}/children")
   async def list_children(...)
   ```

3. **Update MCP Search Tool**
   ```python
   # Enhance search_documents in MCP
   async def search_documents(
       query: str,
       collection_ids: Optional[List[str]] = None,
       collection_paths: Optional[List[str]] = None,
       ...
   )
   ```

4. **Frontend Collection Component**
   ```typescript
   // Create CollectionBrowser.tsx
   const CollectionBrowser = ({ onNavigate, collections }) => {
     // Tree view with folder navigation
   }
   ```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Collections & Folders?
- **Familiarity**: Everyone understands folder structure
- **Flexibility**: Unlimited nesting for any organization style
- **Performance**: Search specific paths for faster results
- **Scalability**: Efficient navigation even with thousands of documents

### Why @ Mentions?
- **Intuitive**: Familiar pattern from social media
- **Flexible**: Can mention multiple contexts
- **Visual**: Clear indication of search scope
- **Extensible**: Can add @user, @date, etc. later

### Why SSE for Progress?
- **Real-time**: Instant updates without polling
- **Simple**: Works with existing HTTP infrastructure
- **Reliable**: Automatic reconnection support
- **Efficient**: Low overhead for progress updates

## 📈 Success Metrics

1. **User Experience**
   - Folder navigation < 100ms
   - Document upload feedback < 1s
   - Progress updates every 2-3s during processing
   - Path-filtered search < 200ms

2. **System Performance**
   - Process 10MB PDF in < 30s
   - Handle 100+ workspaces per user
   - Support 1000+ documents per workspace
   - 99%+ processing success rate

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear API documentation
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Easy to add new MCP tools
   - Simple deployment process

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

### Collection Management
- Tree view with expand/collapse
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Drag-and-drop to move documents
- Right-click context menus

### Document Upload
- Drag-and-drop anywhere
- Multiple file support
- Format validation
- Size limit warnings

### Context Selection
- Autocomplete on @ symbol
- Recent contexts quick access
- Visual tags in message
- Clear scope indicators

## 🔧 Technical Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic CRUD working first
2. **Mock Early**: Use fake progress updates initially
3. **Test Often**: Each phase should be independently testable
4. **Document Well**: API docs as you build
5. **Monitor Performance**: Add metrics from day one

## 🎯 End Goal

A seamless experience where users can:
- Upload documents to organized workspaces
- Watch processing happen in real-time
- Use natural @ mentions to control AI context
- Get accurate, source-cited answers from their knowledge base

The system should feel fast, reliable, and intuitive - making document-based AI interactions as easy as chatting with a knowledgeable assistant who has perfect recall of everything in your files.
